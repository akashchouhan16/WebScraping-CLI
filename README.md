This is a command line tool built using [Nodejs](https://nodejs.dev/learn) and the Google's Node library [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer) which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. It can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.

This CLI takes **IMDb URI**, validates it and then scrapes contents to displays it in the output table. Checkout the previews [here](./previews).
